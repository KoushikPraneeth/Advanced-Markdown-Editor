#  Advanced Markdown Editor

*A focused, high-performance markdown editor for developers*

---

##  Project Overview

The **Advanced Markdown Editor** is a web-based utility designed to offer a fast, polished, and practical writing experience for developers working with Markdown. Rather than trying to mimic full-blown tools like Google Docs or Notion, this project focuses on what actually matters for technical users: great editing experience, real-time preview, easy sharing, and smart export options — all without unnecessary bloat.

Built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **CodeMirror**, it showcases frontend engineering depth, performance tuning, and creative backend-lite thinking through integration with the **GitHub Gist API**.

##  Features (Impressive but Grounded)

### 1. ✨ High-Fidelity Editor with Live Preview

* Integrated **CodeMirror** editor for syntax-highlighted markdown editing
* Live HTML preview rendered side-by-side using `markdown-it`
* Real-time updates with smooth UX
* Optional: diagram support with **Mermaid.js** or **KaTeX** (via plugin-style extension system)

> **Skill Shown:** Complex UI integration, third-party library usage, state syncing across editor and preview.

---

### 2. ⚡ Performance Optimization (Debounced Preview)

* Preview updates are **debounced**, only triggering after user stops typing for a moment
* Prevents laggy UI during fast typing

> **Skill Shown:** Performance awareness, event management, React optimization beyond the basics.

---

### 3.  Smart Persistence via GitHub Gists

* No login system — instead, saving creates an **anonymous GitHub Gist**
* Returns a unique link to the saved file
* Users can **reopen/edit their saved markdown** via Gist ID or shareable link

> **Skill Shown:** REST API integration (GitHub), creative thinking around persistence, problem-solving with real-world constraints.

---

### 4.  Useful Export Options

* Export as:

  *  HTML (copied to clipboard)
  *  PDF (via `html2pdf.js`)
* Clean, user-friendly buttons for one-click export

> **Skill Shown:** File conversion on frontend, data handling, and practical UX.

---

### 5. ️ Custom Themes (Optional)

* Toggle between light/dark editor themes
* Match preview styling to GitHub or Notion aesthetic
* Configurable user preference stored locally

> **Skill Shown:** UI/UX detail, theming systems, and local storage.

---

### 6.  Optional: Shareable Links

* App detects `?gist=xyz123` in URL and loads corresponding file from GitHub
* Enables quick link-sharing of markdown drafts

> **Skill Shown:** URL-based routing, param parsing, dynamic content loading from external APIs.

##  Why I Built This

As a developer, I constantly find myself needing a quick, clean place to write and test markdown — whether it's for README files, documentation, or notes. Most online editors are either bloated or lack essential features like smart saving or export. So I decided to build the tool I wish I had — one that's **fast, practical, and dev-friendly**.
